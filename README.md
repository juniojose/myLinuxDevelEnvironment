# My Linux Devel Environment by Júnio José

This repository contains my notes for setting up a Linux development environment that I use to develop computer programs and others experiences.

## About

At the time of writing this content, I am using an Asus notebook with Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) on a bootable pendrive.

I don't have the concern to evaluate the compatibility with this or that equipment/system. What's here works on my equipment. Try at your own risk.
